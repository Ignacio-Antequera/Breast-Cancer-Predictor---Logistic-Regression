# Breast Cancer Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for classifying breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant based on various features extracted from digitized images of breast mass tissue. The dataset used in this project contains information on the mean, standard error, and "worst" (mean of the three largest values) of ten different characteristics of the cell nuclei, such as radius, texture, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, and fractal dimension.

## Project Structure
- **Data**: This directory contains the dataset used in the project.
- **Notebooks**: This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks used for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, and evaluation.
  - `1_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
  - `2_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb`: Exploratory data analysis including visualizations and feature selection.
  - `3_Model_Development_Logistic_Regression.ipynb`: Development and evaluation of a logistic regression model.
  - `4_Project_Reflection_and_Conclusion.ipynb`: Reflection on the project's methodology, tools, insights, and future directions.
- **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the project, including its objectives, methodology, tools used, and conclusions.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Primary programming language for data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, StatsModels.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Used for interactive development and documentation of the project.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the `Notebooks` directory and run the Jupyter Notebooks in sequential order to execute the data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, and evaluation steps.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the process of developing a predictive model for breast cancer classification using machine learning techniques. It demonstrates the importance of data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature selection, model development, and performance evaluation in the context of healthcare analytics. Moving forward, further research and experimentation with different modeling approaches and datasets could lead to more robust and accurate predictive models for breast cancer diagnosis, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes and healthcare decision-making.
